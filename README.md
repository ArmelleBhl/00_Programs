# 00_Programs

This directory contains Matlab scripts to pre-process holograms taken using a LISST-Holo2 and post-process outputs generated by the software Holo_Batch (Sequoia Scientific Inc.) when reconstructing the holograms.

- The folder "00_Sort relevant holograms" contains the MATLAB codes necessary to pre-process the holograms and find only the relevant holograms for a future analysis : the MATLAB script "main_RelevantHolo.m" and the 3 functions called in this script "FindRelevantRawHolograms.m", "Separate2profiles.m" and "sortie_recherche.m".
- The script "01_CSVtitles.m"
- The script "02_mergeCSV.m"
- The script "03_PlotSizeDistr.m"

> [!NOTE]
> To be able to use these scripts, the data should be stored in folders labeled in the following way:\
> ├── 00_Programs\
> ├── 01_Raw data\
> ├── 02_Cleaned data\
> ├── 03_Processed data\
> The folder "00_Programs" shoud contain the MATLAB scripts. The folders "01_Raw data", "02_Cleaned data" and "03_Processed data" should contain subfolders called yyyymmdd for each of the field campaign.
